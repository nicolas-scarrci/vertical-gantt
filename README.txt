vertical Gantt is a poorly named javascript library that provides a simple way to schedule projects and allocate resources with a focus on visually identifying missed deadlines and overleveraged resources.

To run Vertical Gantt simply open gantt.html in your browser and start adding projects, timeslots, and resources.
To save your plans save the webpage as a new .html file (just be sure to save it in the same folder as gantt.css and gantt.js). 
When you want to revisit your work simply open this .html file and pick up where you left off.
