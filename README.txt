vertical Gantt is a poorly named javascript library that provides a simple way to schedule projects and allocate resources with a focus on visually identifying missed deadlines and overleveraged resources.

To run Vertical Gantt simply open gantt.html in your browser and start adding projects, timeslots, and resources.
To save your plans click the save icon at the bottom left of the table and choose where to save the file (be sure you save it next to gantt.css and gantt.js or it won't work when you open it!)
When you want to revisit your work simply open the new .html file and pick up where you left off.
